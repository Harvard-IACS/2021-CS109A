Non-DCE students should only register if they can attend in person. Does the individual HW mean I have to submit on my own but can I still work with my HW partner? An individual CS109A HW means you are supposed to work on your own, without any human intervention, assistance, or input. You are not allowed to work with partner. You are allowed to use OHs to ask for clarification questions, but we may not be able to answer all of your questions or help with your coding. You are allowed to use all of your materials from the course up to the HW, look at problem resolution online, and look at libraries documentation. Where should I send my questions? Use Ed for anying related to the course content or assignments. All other concerns should be sent to the course helpline: cs109a2021@gmail.com Auditing Can I audit this course? What are the rules for auditing? Yes, you are welcome to audit this course. Send an email to cs109a2021@gmail.com to request full Canvas access. All auditors must agree to abide by the following rules: All auditors are held to the same standard of academic honesty as our registered students. Please do not share homeworks or solutions with anyone. Violations will be reported to the Harvard Administrative Board. Auditors are not permitted to take the course for credit in the future. Auditors may not attend lectures or section during the live stream. Students are randomly assigned to small groups for coding exercises and mixing auditors and students in this way is not ideal. We are investigating methods that would allow auditors to join, but this is the current policy. Audiors should not submit HWs or participate in projects. Auditors should refrain from using any course and TF resources that are designed for our registered students like Ed, Jupyter Hub, and office hours. Auditors must have an active HUID number. Quizzes & Exercises When are quizzes and exercises due? Quizzes and exercises are due before the next lecture. I missed a quiz/exercise. Can I make it up? No. We will drop your lowest 25% of quizzes and your lowest 25% of exercises. This policy is to reduce stress and is in place so that missing a quiz or exercise on occasion should not affect your final grade.","tags":"pages","url":"pages/faq.html"},{"title":"Preparation","text":"In order to get the most out of CS109A, knowledge of multivariate calculus, probability theory, statistics, and some basic linear algebra (e.g., matrix operations, eigenvectors, etc.) is suggested. Below are some resources for self-assessment and review: Multivariate Calculus : multiple exams /w solutions Linear Algebra: multiple exams /w solutions 1 , 2 Probability: exams with solutions and problem sets with solutions Statistics: multiple pairs of exam questions and answers Q1 , A1 , Q2 , A2 , Q3 , A3 Here is a useful textbook for reviewing many of the above topics: Mathematics for Machine Learning Note: you can be successful in the course (assignments, quizzes, etc.) with the listed pre-requisites, but some of the material presented in lectures may be more easily understood with more background. This course dives right into core Machine Learning topics. For this, students are expected to be fluent in Python programming. You can familiarize yourself with Python by completing online tutorials. Additionally, there are free Basics Python courses that cover all necessary python topics. You are also expected to be able to manipulate data using pandas DataFrames, perform basic operations with numpy arrays, and make use of basic plotting functions (e.g. line chart, histogram, scatter plot, bar chart) from matplotlib. Python basics Throughout this course, we will be using Python as our primary programming language for exercises, labs, and homework. Thus, you must have basic Python programming knowledge. The following are the topics you need to cross off your checklist before the course begins: Variables, Datatypes, strings, file operations, Data structures such as lists, dictionaries, tuples and classes. Pandas Basics Most of the exercises you will encounter in this course exploit various datasets. Pandas is an open-source data analysis and manipulation tool, built on top of Python. In this course, we have provided the necessary support material and resources to work with Pandas. However, it is highly recommended that you get yourselves familiar with basic data manipulation using Pandas to ensure a smooth learning experience. Numpy Basics NumPy is a library for the Python programming language that provides support for large, multi-dimensional arrays and matrices and a large collection of high-level mathematical functions to operate on these data structures. Because of the extensive exercises provided in this course, it is important to use Numpy for efficient problem-solving to get identical results. Though this course aims to support individuals with no prior Numpy knowledge, you must go through the basics of this library to avoid any possible hiccups. Matplotlib Basics A large portion of this course uses different graphs and charts to explain topics and validate results. Matplotlib is a plotting library for Python. This library has been used to create all the graphs you will see throughout the course. Additionally, the exercises and homeworks are structured in a manner that integrates this library. Henceforth, it is highly recommended to get yourselves acquainted with Matplotlib Basics. For this course, we will be using Jupyter Notebooks. You can familiarize yourself with Jupyter notebooks by reading the following tutorials: A Beginner's Tutorial to Jupyter Notebooks Finally, we assume that students have a strong foundation in calculus, linear algebra, statistics, and probability. You should review these concepts before the course begins.

(identical material) [starts 9/11] Advanced Sections: Wed at 12pm [starts 9/23] Office Hours: (TBD) Format: Exclusively online, but we aim to foster enriching interactions and collaboration as much as possible. Prerequisites: You are expected to have programming experience at the level of CS 50 or above, and statistics knowledge at the level of Stat 100 or above (Stat 110 recommended). HW #0 is designed to test your knowledge on the prerequisites. Successful completion of this assignment will show that this course is suitable for you. HW #0 will not be graded but you are required to submit. Welcome to CS109a/STAT121a/AC209a, also offered by the DCE as CSCI E-109a, Introduction to Data Science. This course is the first half of a one‐year course in data science. The course focuses on the analysis of messy, real-life data to perform predictions using statistical and machine learning methods. Throughout the semester, our content continuously centers around five key facets: 1. data collection ‐ data wrangling, cleaning, and sampling to get a suitable data set; 2. data management ‐ accessing data quickly and reliably; 3. exploratory data analysis – generating hypotheses and building intuition; 4. prediction or statistical learning; and 5. communication – summarizing results through visualization, stories, and interpretable summaries. Only one of CS109a, AC209a, or STAT121a can be taken for credit. Students who have previously taken CS109, AC209, or STAT121 cannot take CS109A, AC 209A, or STAT121A for credit. Course Components The lectures will be live-streamed and can be accessed through the Zoom section on Canvas. Video recordings of the live stream will be made available within 24 hours after the event, and will be accessible from the Lecture Video section on Canvas. Lectures The class meets, virtually, three days a week for lectures (M, W, F). The same lecture will be given twice each day: once in the morning and again in the afternoon, to accommodate students in different time zones. Mondays and Wednesdays will be mostly lecture content with some hands-on coding, whereas Fridays will be the inverse (mostly hands-on coding). Attending and participating in lectures is a crucial component of learning the material presented in this course. What to expect A lecture will have the following pedagogy layout which will be repeated: Asynchronous pre-class exercises of approxmately 30 min. This will include, reading from the textbooks or other sources, watching videos to prepare you for the class. Approx. 10 minutes of Q&A regarding the pre-class exercises and/or review of homework and quiz questions. Live online instruction followed by a short Q/A session Hands-on exercises, on the ED platform. Sessions will help students develop the intuition for the core concepts, provide the necessary mathematical background, and provide guidance on technical details. Sessions will be accompanied by relevant examples to clarify key concepts and techniques. Quizzes At the end of each lecture, there will be a short, graded quiz that will cover the pre-class and in-class material; there will be no AC209a content in the quizzes. The quizzes will be available until the next lecture. 25% of the quizzes will be dropped from your grade. Exercises Lectures will include one or more coding exercises focused on the newly introduced material; there will be no AC209a content in the exercises. The exercises are short enough to be completed during the time allotted in lecture but they will remain available until the beginning of the following lecture to accomodate those who cannot attend in real time. 25% of the exercises will be dropped from your grade. Sections Lectures are supplemented by sections led by teaching fellows. There are two types of sections: Standard Sections : This will be a mix of review of material and practice problems similar to the HW. The material covered on Friday and Monday is identical. Advanced Sections The course will include advanced sections for 209a students and will cover a different topic per week. These are 75-min lectures and will cover advanced topics like the mathematical underpinnings of the methods seen in lecture and hands-on exercises, along with extensions of those methods. The material covered in the advanced sections is required for all AC209a students. Note: Sections are not held every week. Consult the course calendar for exact dates. Exams There are no exams in this course. Projects Students will work in groups of 2-4 to complete a final group project, due during the Exams period. See Calendar for specific dates. Homework Assignments There will be 9 graded homework assignments. Some of them will be due one week after being assigned, and some will be due two weeks after being assigned. You have the option to work and submit in pairs for all the assignments except HW4 and HW7, which you will do individually. You will be working in Jupyter Notebooks, which you can run in your own environment or in the SEAS JupyterHub cloud. Instructions for Setting up Your Environment Instructions for Using JupyterHub On weeks with new assignments, the assignments will be released by Wednesday 3pm. Standard assignments are graded out of 5 points. AC209a students will have additional homework content for most assignments worth 1 point. Instructor Office Hours Pavlos : (TBD) Kevin : (TBD) Chris : (TBD) Eleni : (TBD) Participation Students are expected to be actively engaged with the course. This includes: Attending and participating in lectures (or the follow-up session later in the day) Making use of resources such as office hours and sections Participating in the Ed discussion forum — both through asking thoughtful questions and by answering the questions of others Despite being remote, we aim to make this course as interactive, stimulating, and fun as always, and we rely on each of you to contribute your awesome uniqueness.

Deep Learning, Vol. 1 & 2: From Basics to Practice by Andrew Glassner Deep Learning by Ian Goodfellow and Yoshua Bengio and Aaron Courville (MIT Press, 2016) Course Policies Getting Help For questions about homework, course content, package installation, JupyterHub, and after you have tried to troubleshoot yourselves, the process to get help is: 1. Post the question in Ed and get a response from your peers. Note that in Ed questions are visible to everyone. The teaching staff monitors the posts. 2. Go to Office Hours ; this is the best way to get direct help. 3. For private matters send an email to the Helpline: cs109a2020@gmail.com . The Helpline is monitored by the teaching staff. 4. For personal and confidential matters send an email to the instructors . Collaboration Policy We expect you to adhere to the Harvard Honor Code at all times. Failure to adhere to the honor code and our policies may result in serious penalties, up to and including automatic failure in the course and reference to the ad board. If you work with a partner on an assignment make sure both parties solve all the problems. Do not divide and conquer. You are expected to be intellectually honest and give credit where credit is due. In particular: if you work with a fellow student but decide to submit individual assignments, include the name of each other in the designated area of the submission. if you work with a fellow student and want to submit the same assignment, you need to form a group prior to the submission. Details in the assignment. Remember, not all assignments will permit group submissions. you need to write your solutions entirely on your own or with your collaborator (e.g., not entirely from Google search results) you are welcome to take ideas from code presented in lecture or section, but you need to change it, adapt it to your style, and ultimately write your own. We do not want to see code copied verbatim from the above sources. if you use code found on the internet, books, or other sources you need to cite those sources. you should not view any written materials or code created by other students for the same assignment; you may not provide or make available solutions to individuals who take or may take this course in the future. if the assignment allows it you may use third-party libraries and example code, so long as the material is available to all students in the class and you give proper attribution. Do not remove any original copyright notices and headers. Late or Wrongly Submitted Assignments There are no late days in homework submission. We will accept late submissions only for medical (if accompanied by a doctor's note) or other official University-excused reasons. To submit after Canvas has closed or to ask for an extension , send an email to the Helpline with subject line \"Submit HW1: Reason=the flu\" replacing 'HW1' with the name of the current assignment and \"the flu\" with your reason. You need to attach the note from your medical provider otherwise we will not accept the request. Email the instructors if you have other University-excused reasons. If you forgot to join a Group with your peer and are asking for the same grade we will accept this with no penalty up to HW3. For homeworks beyond that we feel that you should be familiar with the process of joining groups. After that there will be a penalty of -1 point for both members of the group provided the submission was on time. Grading Guidelines Homework will be graded based on: 1. How correct your code is (the Notebook cells should run, we are not troubleshooting code) 2. How you have interpreted the results — we want text not just code. It should be a report. 3. How well you present the results. The scale is 0 to 5 for each assignment. Re-grade Requests Our graders and instructors make every effort in grading accurately and in giving you a lot of feedback. If you discover that your answer to a homework problem was correct but it was marked as incorrect, send an email to the Helpline with a description of the error. Please do not submit regrade requests based on what you perceive is overly harsh grading , The points we take off are based on a grading rubric that is being applied uniformly to all submissions. If you decide to send a regrade request , send an email to the Helpline with subject line \"Regrade HW1: Grader=johnsmith\" replacing 'HW1' with the current assignment and 'johnsmith' with the name of the grader within 48 hours of the grade release . Zoom Expectations: Despite being remote and distributed, we want everyone to participate and engage with fellow classmates and staff. To this end, we request for everyone to leave his/her/their video on during class. We fully understand that some may be uncomfortable or unable to do so, for various personal reasons. We respect your decision and empathize for any situation that may arise. Nonetheless, if possible, we strongly ask for you to please leave your video on. Many are getting accustomed to Zoom for the first time. While it is understandable to have some glitches, mistakes, and faux pas, some mistakes can be largely disruptive to such a large audience like that of our class. Please familiarize yourself to Zoom before the semester begins. In particular, please: keep your video on (see above) keep your mic muted by default, until you speak be mindful of overtly distracting actions that your video may cause (this isn't a large issue, but it's akin to students' laptops distracting those who sit nearby) be mindful of your mic settings after returning to the main room from a break-out room, as it tends to un-mute each person's mic. Communication from Staff to Students Class announcements will be through Ed . All homework and will be posted and submitted through Canvas . Quizzes are completed on Ed as well as all feedback forms. NOTE: make sure you adjust your account settings so you can receive emails from Canvas. Submitting an assignment Please consult Homework Policies & Submission Instructions [Update link] Course Grade Your final score for the course will be computed using the following weights: Assignment Final Grade Weight Homework 0 1% Paired Homework (7) 42% Individual Homework (2) 20% Quizzes 6% Exercises 6% Project 25% Total 100% Software We will be using Jupyter Notebooks, Python 3, and various python modules. You can access the notebook viewer either on your own machine by installing the Anaconda platform (Links to an external site) which includes Jupyter/IPython as well all packages that will be required for the course, or by using the SEAS JupyterHub from Canvas. Details in class. Auditing the Class If you would like to audit the class, please send an email to the Helpline indicating who you are and why you want to audit the class. You need a HUID to be included to Canvas. Please note that auditors may not submit assignments for grading or make use of other limited student resources such as office hours. Academic Integrity Ethical behavior is an important trait of a Data Scientist, from ethically handling data to attribution of code and work of others. Thus, in CS109A we give a strong emphasis to Academic Honesty. As a student your best guidelines are to be reasonable and fair. We encourage teamwork for problem sets, but you should not split the homework and you should work on all the problems together. For more detailed expectations, please refer to the Collaborations section above. Accommodations for Students with Disabilities Students needing academic adjustments or accommodations because of a documented disability must present their Faculty Letter from the Accessible Education Office (AEO) and speak with the professor by the end of the second week of the term, (fill in specific date). Failure to do so may result in the Course Head's inability to respond in a timely manner. All discussions will remain confidential, although Faculty are invited to contact AEO to discuss appropriate implementation. Diversity and Inclusion Statement Data Science and Computer Science have historically been representative of only a small sliver of the population. This is despite the contributions of a diverse group of early pioneers - see Ada Lovelace, Dorothy Vaughan, and Grace Hopper for just a few examples. As educators, we aim to build a diverse, inclusive, and representative community offering opportunities in data science to those who have been historically marginalized. We will encourage learning that advances ethical data science, exposes bias in the way data science is used, and advances research into fair and responsible data science. We need your help to create a learning environment that supports a diversity of thoughts, perspectives, and experiences, and honors your identities (including but not limited to race, gender, class, sexuality, religion, ability, etc.) To help accomplish this: If you have a name and/or set of pronouns that differ from those in your official Harvard records, please let us know! If you feel like your performance in the class is being impacted by your experiences outside of class, please do not hesitate to come and talk with us. We want to be a resource for you. Remember that you can also submit anonymous feedback (which will lead to us making a general announcement to the class, if necessary, to address your concerns). If you prefer to speak with someone outside of the course, you may find helpful resources at the Harvard Office of Diversity and Inclusion. We (like many people) are still learning about diverse perspectives and identities. If something was said in class (by anyone) that made you feel uncomfortable, please talk to us about it. As a participant in course discussions, you are expected to respect your classmates' diverse backgrounds and perspectives. Our course will discuss diversity, inclusion, and ethics in data science. Please contact us (in person or electronically) or submit anonymous feedback if you have any suggestions for how we can improve.","tags":"pages","url":"pages/syllabus_2020.html"},{"title":"Syllabus","text":"TENTATIVE SYLLABUS SUBJECT TO CHANGE Introduction to Data Science (Fall 2021) CS 109a, AC 209a, Stat 121a, or CSCI E-109a Course Heads Pavlos Protopapas (SEAS) and Natesh Pillai (Statistics) Lectures: Mon & Wed 9:45am-11am in SEC 1.321 Lecture Hall Labs: Friday 9:45am-11am in SEC 1.321 Lecture Hall Advanced Sections: Wed 12:45-2pm [starts 9/22] (room to be announced) Office Hours: (times and rooms to be announced) Prerequisites: You are expected to have programming experience at the level of CS 50 or above, and statistics knowledge at the level of Stat 100 or above (Stat 110 recommended).

You can access the notebook viewer either on your own machine by installing the Anaconda platform (Links to an external site) which includes Jupyter/IPython as well all packages that will be required for the course, or by using the SEAS JupyterHub from Canvas. Details in class. Auditing the Class If you would like to audit the class, please send an email to the Helpline indicating who you are and why you want to audit the class. You need a HUID to be included to Canvas. Please note that auditors may not submit assignments for grading or make use of other limited student resources such as office hours. Academic Integrity Ethical behavior is an important trait of a Data Scientist, from ethically handling data to attribution of code and work of others. Thus, in CS109A we give a strong emphasis to Academic Honesty. As a student your best guidelines are to be reasonable and fair. We encourage teamwork for problem sets, but you should not split the homework and you should work on all the problems together. For more detailed expectations, please refer to the Collaborations section above. Accommodations for Students with Disabilities Students needing academic adjustments or accommodations because of a documented disability must present their Faculty Letter from the Accessible Education Office (AEO) and speak with the professor by the end of the second week of the term, (fill in specific date). Failure to do so may result in the Course Head's inability to respond in a timely manner. All discussions will remain confidential, although Faculty are invited to contact AEO to discuss appropriate implementation. Diversity and Inclusion Statement Data Science and Computer Science have historically been representative of only a small sliver of the population. This is despite the contributions of a diverse group of early pioneers - see Ada Lovelace, Dorothy Vaughan, and Grace Hopper for just a few examples. As educators, we aim to build a diverse, inclusive, and representative community offering opportunities in data science to those who have been historically marginalized. We will encourage learning that advances ethical data science, exposes bias in the way data science is used, and advances research into fair and responsible data science. We need your help to create a learning environment that supports a diversity of thoughts, perspectives, and experiences, and honors your identities (including but not limited to race, gender, class, sexuality, religion, ability, etc.) To help accomplish this: If you have a name and/or set of pronouns that differ from those in your official Harvard records, please let us know! If you feel like your performance in the class is being impacted by your experiences outside of class, please do not hesitate to come and talk with us. We want to be a resource for you. Remember that you can also submit anonymous feedback (which will lead to us making a general announcement to the class, if necessary, to address your concerns). If you prefer to speak with someone outside of the course, you may find helpful resources at the Harvard Office of Diversity and Inclusion. We (like many people) are still learning about diverse perspectives and identities. If something was said in class (by anyone) that made you feel uncomfortable, please talk to us about it. As a participant in course discussions, you are expected to respect your classmates' diverse backgrounds and perspectives. Our course will discuss diversity, inclusion, and ethics in data science. Please contact us (in person or electronically) or submit anonymous feedback if you have any suggestions for how we can improve. Extension School Policies Accommodation Requests. Harvard Extension School is committed to providing an inclusive, accessible academic community for students with disabilities and chronic health conditions. The Accessibility Services Office (ASO) (https://extension.harvard.edu/for-students/support-and-services/accessibility-services/) offers accommodations and support to students with documented disabilities. If you have a need for accommodations or adjustments, contact Accessibility Services directly via email at accessibility@extension.harvard.edu or by phone at 617-998-9640. Academic Integrity. You are responsible for understanding Harvard Extension School policies on academic integrity (https://extension.harvard.edu/for-students/student-policies-conduct/academic-integrity/) and how to use sources responsibly. Stated most broadly, academic integrity means that all course work submitted, whether a draft or a final version of a paper, project, take-home exam, online exam, computer program, oral presentation, or lab report, must be your own words and ideas, or the sources must be clearly acknowledged. The potential outcomes for violations of academic integrity are serious and ordinarily include all of the following: required withdrawal (RQ), which means a failing grade in the course (with no refund), the suspension of registration privileges, and a notation on your transcript. Using sources responsibly (https://extension.harvard.edu/for-students/support-and-services/using-sources-effectively-and-responsibly/) is an essential part of your Harvard education. We provide additional information about our expectations regarding academic integrity on our website. We invite you to review that information and to check your understanding of academic citation rules by completing two free online 15-minute tutorials that are also available on our site. (The tutorials are anonymous open-learning tools.)","tags":"pages","url":"pages/syllabus.html"},{"title":"CS109a: Introduction to Data Science","text":"Fall 2021 Pavlos Protopapas and Natesh Pillai Welcome to CS109a/STAT121a/AC209a, also offered by the DCE as CSCI E-109a, Introduction to Data Science. This course is the first half of a one‐year course to data science. We will focus on the analysis of data to perform predictions using statistical and machine learning methods. Topics include data scraping, data management, data visualization, regression and classification methods, and deep neural networks. You will get ample practice through weekly homework assignments. The class material integrates the five key facets of an investigation using data: 1. data collection ‐ data wrangling, cleaning, and sampling to get a suitable data set 2. data management ‐ accessing data quickly and reliably 3. exploratory data analysis – generating hypotheses and building intuition 4. prediction or statistical learning 5. communication – summarizing results through visualization, stories, and interpretable summaries Only one of CS 109a, AC 209a, or Stat 121a can be taken for credit. Students who have previously taken CS 109, AC 209, or Stat 121 cannot take CS 109a, AC 209a, or Stat 121a for credit.
