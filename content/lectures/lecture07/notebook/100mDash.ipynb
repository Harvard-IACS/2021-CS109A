    "- In this exercise, you will simulate the 100m sprint race discussed during the lecture.\n",
    "- We have already defined for you a Sprinter() class which has two characteristics for each sprinter:\n",
    "    - Base time \n",
    "    - Performance variance \n",
    "- Run the code cell that makes four instances of the `Sprinter()` class. You will work with those for the entire exercise.\n",
    "- Call the time attribute of the helper class to get the time taken by a competitor in the actual race.\n",
    "- First run the race simulation five times; you will do this by creating a dictionary with participant name as keys, and time taken in a simulated race as the values. You will sort this dictionary by values and determine the winner of the simulated race.\n",
    "- Repeat the simulation of the race for 10,000 times and count who won the race for how many times. Based on this observation, you will then investigate why a particular participant won as many times?\n",
    "- Repeat the simulation for 10,000 times, but this time get the distribution of times for each participant over these runs. \n",
    "- Calculate the mean race time, standard deviation of the race time and the confidence interval for each participant.\n",
    "- Use the helper code to observe a plot similar to the one given below:\n",
