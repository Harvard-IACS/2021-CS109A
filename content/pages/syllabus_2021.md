Welcome to CS109a/STAT121a/AC209a, also offered by the DCE as CSCI E-109a, Introduction to Data Science. This course is the first half of a one‐year course in data science. The course focuses on the analysis of messy, real-life data to perform predictions using statistical and machine learning methods.

Throughout the semester, our content continuously centers around five key facets:

**1.** data collection ‐ data wrangling, cleaning, and sampling to get a suitable data set;

**2.**  data management ‐ accessing data quickly and reliably;

**3.** exploratory data analysis – generating hypotheses and building intuition;

**4.** prediction or statistical learning; and

**5.** communication – summarizing results through visualization, stories, and interpretable summaries.

Only one of CS109a, AC209a, or STAT121a can be taken for credit. Students who have previously taken CS109, AC209, or STAT121 cannot take CS109A, AC 209A, or STAT121A for credit.

### Course Components <a name='course-components'></a>
The lectures, labs, and advanced sections will be recorded and accessed through the Zoom section on Canvas for Extension School students. <mark>Attendance is required for on campus students.</mark>

#### Lectures <a name='lectures'></a>
The class meets for lectures twice a week for lectures (M & W). Attending and participating in lectures is a crucial component of learning the material presented in this course.

**What to expect** 
![Class Structure](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Harvard-IACS/2020-CS109A/master/content/pages/ClassSturcture_new_repeat.png?raw=true)

A lecture will have the following pedagogy layout which will be repeated:

+ Asynchronous pre-class exercises of approxmately 30 min. This will include, reading from the textbooks or other sources, watching videos to prepare you for the class.  
+ Approx. 10 minutes of Q&A regarding the pre-class exercises and/or review of homework and quiz questions. 
+ Live online instruction followed by a short Q/A session 
+ Hands-on exercises, on the ED platform.
Sessions will help students develop the intuition for the core concepts, provide the necessary mathematical background, and provide guidance on technical details.
Sessions will be accompanied by relevant examples to clarify key concepts and techniques.

#### Labs <a name='labs'></a>
Lab will be held every Friday at the same time and place as lectures. Labs guided hands-on coding challenges which will prepare students for successfully completing the homework assignments.

#### Quizzes <a name='in-class-quizzes'></a>
At the end of each lecture, there will be a short, graded quiz that will cover the pre-class and in-class material; there will be no AC209a content in the quizzes.  The quizzes will be available until the next lecture.

25% of the quizzes will be dropped from your grade.

#### Exercises <a name='in-class-exercises'></a>
Lectures will include one or more coding exercises focused on the newly introduced material; there will be no AC209a content in the exercises. The exercises are short enough to be completed during the time allotted in lecture but they will remain available until the beginning of the following lecture to accomodate those who cannot attend in real time.

Your final grade will be calculated twice: one including exercise grades and one without. You will be given the higher of the two. In this way, exercises can only help your grade.

##### Advanced Sections <a name='advanced-sections'></a>
The course will include advanced sections for 209a students and will cover a different topic per week. These are 75-min lectures and will cover advanced topics like the mathematical underpinnings of the methods seen in lecture and hands-on exercises, along with extensions of those methods. The material covered in the advanced sections is </span><strong>required </strong> for all AC209a students. But all students are welcome and encouraged to attendadvanced sections.

Note: Advanced sections are not held every week. Consult the course schedule for exact dates.



#### Exams <a name='exams'></a>
There will be a midterm exam. More details to follow.

#### Projects <a name='projects'></a>

Students will work in groups of 2-4 to complete a final group project, due during the Exams period. See schedule for specific dates.

#### Homework Assignments <a name='homework-assignments'></a>
There will be 8 graded homework assignments. Some of them will be due one week after being assigned, and some will be due two weeks after being assigned. You have the option to work and submit in pairs for all the assignments **except** HW2 and HW7, which you will do individually.

You will be working in Jupyter Notebooks, which you can run in your own environment or in the SEAS JupyterHub cloud.

[Instructions for Setting up Your Environment] (coming soon)

[Instructions for Using JupyterHub] (coming soon)

On weeks with new assignments, the assignments will be released by Wednesday 3pm.

Standard assignments are graded out of 5 points.

AC209a students will have additional homework content for most assignments worth 1 point.


#### Instructor Office Hours

**Natesh**: (TBD)

**Pavlos**: (TBD) 

**Eleni**: (TBD)


#### Participation 
Students are expected to be actively engaged with the course. This includes:

1. Attending and participating in lectures 
2. Making use of office hours
3. Participating in the Ed discussion forum — both through asking thoughtful questions and by answering the questions of others

### Course Policies


#### Getting Help

For questions about homework, course content, package installation, JupyterHub, and after you have tried to troubleshoot yourselves, the process to get help is:

**1.** Post the question in **Ed** and get a response from your peers.  Note that in Ed questions are visible to everyone. The teaching staff monitors the posts.

**2.** Go to **Office Hours**; this is the best way to get direct help.

**3.** For private matters send an email to the **Helpline:** <cs109a2021@gmail.com>.
The Helpline is monitored by the teaching staff.

**4.** For personal and confidential matters send an email to the **instructors**.

#### Collaboration Policy <a name='collaboration-policy'></a>
We expect you to adhere to the [Harvard Honor Code](http://honor.fas.harvard.edu/honor-code) at all times. Failure to adhere to the honor code and our policies may result in serious penalties, up to and including automatic failure in the course and reference to the ad board.
If you work with a partner on an assignment make sure both parties solve all the problems. Do not divide and conquer. You are expected to be intellectually honest and give credit where credit is due.
In particular:

* if you work with a fellow student but decide to submit individual assignments, include the name of each other in the designated area of the submission.
* if you work with a fellow student and want to submit the same assignment, you need to form a group prior to the submission. Details in the assignment. Remember, not all assignments will permit group submissions.
* you need to write your solutions entirely on your own or with your collaborator (e.g., not entirely from Google search results)
* you are welcome to take ideas from code presented in lecture or section, but you need to change it, adapt it to your style, and ultimately write your own. We do not want to see code copied verbatim from the above sources.
* if you use code found on the internet, books, or other sources you need to cite those sources.
* you should not view any written materials or code created by other students for the same assignment;
* you may not provide or make available solutions to individuals who take or may take this course in the future.
* if the assignment allows it you may use third-party libraries and example code, so long as the material is available to all students in the class and you give proper attribution. Do not remove any original copyright notices and headers.

#### Late or Wrongly Submitted Assignments <a name='late-or-wrongly-submitted-assignments'></a>
There are <strong>no late</strong> days in homework submission. We will accept late submissions only for medical (if accompanied by a doctor's note) or other official University-excused reasons.

<strong>To submit after Canvas has closed or to ask for an extension</strong>, send an email to the Helpline with subject line "Submit HW1: Reason=the flu" &nbsp;replacing 'HW1' with the name of the current assignment and "the flu" with your reason. You need to attach the note from your medical provider otherwise we will not accept the request.  Email the instructors if you have other University-excused reasons.

<strong>If you forgot to join a Group with your peer</strong> and are asking for the same grade we will accept this with no penalty up to HW3. For homeworks beyond that we feel that you should be familiar with the process of joining groups. After that there will be a penalty of -1 point for both members of the group provided the submission was on time.

#### Grading Guidelines

Homework will be graded based on:

**1.** How correct your code is  (the Notebook cells should run, we are not troubleshooting code)

**2.** How you have interpreted the results — we want text not just code. It should be a report.

**3.** How well you present the results.

The scale is 0 to 5 for each assignment.

#### Re-grade Requests <a name='re-grade-requests'></a>
Our graders and instructors make every effort in grading accurately and in giving you a lot of feedback.

If you discover that your answer to a homework problem was correct but it was marked as incorrect, send an email to the Helpline with a description of the error. <strong> Please do not submit regrade requests based</strong> <strong>on what you perceive is overly harsh grading</strong>, The points we take off are based on a grading rubric that is being applied uniformly to all submissions.

<strong>If you decide to send a regrade request</strong>, send an email to the Helpline with subject line "Regrade HW1: Grader=johnsmith" &nbsp;replacing 'HW1' with the current assignment and 'johnsmith' with the name of the grader within  </span><strong>48 hours of the grade release</strong>.

#### Communication from Staff to Students

Class announcements will be through **Ed**. All homework and will be posted and submitted through **Canvas**. Quizzes are completed on **Ed** as well as all feedback forms.

 <span style="color:red">**NOTE:**</span> make sure you adjust your account settings so you can receive emails from Canvas.


#### Submitting an assignment

Please consult [Homework Policies & Submission Instructions] (coming soon)

| **Total**                      | **100%**           |


#### Software

We will be using Jupyter Notebooks, Python 3, and various python modules. You can access the notebook viewer either on your own machine by installing the [Anaconda platform (Links to an external site)](https://docs.continuum.io/anaconda/) which includes Jupyter/IPython as well all packages that will be required for the course, or by using the SEAS JupyterHub from Canvas. Details in class.

#### Auditing the Class <a name='auditing-the-class'></a>
If you would like to audit the class, please send an email to the Helpline indicating who you are and why you want to audit the class. You need a HUID to be included to Canvas. Please note that auditors may not submit assignments for grading or make use of other limited student resources such as office hours.</p>

#### Academic Integrity <a name='academic-integrity'></a>
Ethical behavior is an important trait of a Data Scientist, from ethically handling data to attribution of code and work of others. Thus, in CS109A we give a strong emphasis to Academic Honesty.
As a student your best guidelines are to be reasonable and fair. We encourage teamwork for problem sets, but you should not split the homework and you should work on all the problems together.
For more detailed expectations, please refer to the Collaborations section above.

#### Accommodations for Students with Disabilities <a name='accommodations-for-students-with-disabilities'></a>
Students needing academic adjustments or accommodations because of a documented disability must present their Faculty Letter from the [Accessible Education Office (AEO)](http://www.aeo.fas.harvard.edu/) and speak with the professor by the end of the second week of the term, (fill in specific date). Failure to do so may result in the Course Head's inability to respond in a timely manner. All discussions will remain confidential, although Faculty are invited to contact AEO to discuss appropriate implementation.

#### Diversity and Inclusion Statement <a name='diversity-and-inclusion-statement'></a>
Data Science and Computer Science have historically been representative of only a small sliver of the population. This is despite the contributions of a diverse group of early pioneers - see Ada Lovelace, Dorothy Vaughan, and Grace Hopper for just a few examples.

As educators, we aim to build a diverse, inclusive, and representative community offering opportunities in data science to those who have been historically marginalized. We will encourage learning that advances ethical data science, exposes bias in the way data science is used, and advances research into fair and responsible data science.

We need your help to create a learning environment that supports a diversity of thoughts, perspectives, and experiences, and honors your identities (including but not limited to race, gender, class, sexuality, religion, ability, etc.) To help accomplish this:

- If you have a name and/or set of pronouns that differ from those in your official Harvard records, please let us know!

- If you feel like your performance in the class is being impacted by your experiences outside of class, please do not hesitate to come and talk with us. We want to be a resource for you. Remember that you can also submit anonymous feedback (which will lead to us making a general announcement to the class, if necessary, to address your concerns). If you prefer to speak with someone outside of the course, you may find helpful resources at the Harvard Office of Diversity and Inclusion.

- We (like many people) are still learning about diverse perspectives and identities. If something was said in class (by anyone) that made you feel uncomfortable, please talk to us about it.

- As a participant in course discussions, you are expected to respect your classmates’ diverse backgrounds and perspectives.

Our course will discuss diversity, inclusion, and ethics in data science. Please contact us (in person or electronically) or submit anonymous feedback if you have any suggestions for how we can improve.
